# Project Rules

## Pull Request Guidelines
- When creating a Release Pull Request from the `dev` branch to the `main` branch, no additional version bump is required (as it should already be updated in `dev`). However, you must explicitly highlight the accumulated version difference between `main` and `dev` (e.g., `1.0.0` ➔ `1.1.0`) in the PR title or description so reviewers can easily trace the release version.

- When creating a Pull Request to the `dev` branch, you must bump the version in `package.json` and run `npm install` before committing.

- Always write Pull Request titles and bodies in detailed English.

## Git Branch Guidelines
- Branches must be created using the format: `anti/v1/{type:feat|chore|refactor|fix|hotfix}/{description}`

## Pre-PR Requirements
- Always run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` (or equivalent formatting/linting scripts) to ensure code quality before creating a Pull Request.
